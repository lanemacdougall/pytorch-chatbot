## <a name="description"></a> Description
Basic retrieval-based conversational agent (chatbot) intended to be used by a fictional bulk coffee supplier, GroundsKeeper Coffee, Co.
The chatbot, nicknamed Bean, is capable of recording users' orders and answering questions about the business' available coffee varieties and hours of operation, the availability of customer service representatives, as well as shipping and payment.

This retrieval-based chatbot is implemented using PyTorch and Python NLTK Libraries. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques performed on training data and user input is done using Python NLTK Libraries. A neural network model, implemented using the PyTorch framework and trained on the data in [intents.json](https://github.com/lanemacdougall/project-3-chatbot/blob/main/intents.json), enables the chatbot to perform intent classification on user input. The predicted intent is then used to retrieve an appropriate response.
